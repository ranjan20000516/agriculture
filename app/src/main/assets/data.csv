1,0,Introduction,doc,"#Iintroduction.jpegqq• In India, citrus fruits ranks third in production after banana and mango. Among citrus crops, mandarin orange (Kinnow mandarin, Nagpur, Khasi, Darjling) covers largest area followed by sweet orange (Musambi, Pineapple, Blood Red and Jaffa) and Acid lime. Among these, Kinnow mandarin bears highest place in production, productivity, juice content and fruit quality. In India, Kinnow is being grown in Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and Utter Pradesh.qq• The 'Kinnow' is a high yield mandarin hybrid cultivated extensively in the wider Punjab region of India and Pakistan. It is a hybrid of two citrus cultivars— 'King' (Citrus nobilis) × 'Willow Leaf' (Citrus × deliciosa) — first developed by Howard B. Frost, at the University of California Citrus Experiment Station. After evaluation, the 'Kinnow' was released as a new citrus hybrid for commercial cultivation in 1935. In a hot climate, plants can grow up to 35 feet (11 m) high.qq• 'Kinnow' trees are highly productive; it is not uncommon to find 1,000 fruits per tree. The fruit matures in January or February. It peels easily and has a high juice content. The high seed content in this variety is a major hindrance in out-of-hand eating. The mature citrus tree is a living and changing entity. Under the influence of a Mediterranean type, subtropical climate citrus species become dormant in winter, but do not shed their leaves. Auxiliary buds begin to break during warm spell, but the new shoots do not actively grow until late February or March. Flowering and fruit formation occur annually in most citrus species. Leaves auxiliary buds, thorns, flowers, and fruits are produced on citrus stem. Leaves are arranged spirally around the stem, and phyllotaxy is 3/8 for different species including mandarin. Citrus leaf is unifoliately compound and pinnately reticulate in venation.qq• Abscission zones occur between the petiole and stem. The dormant auxiliary vegetative bud begins growing as vegetative shoots. The interest of farmers in adoption of Kinnow cultivation is increasing day by day due to suitable agro-climatic conditions, higher crop yield and demand in international market."

6,0,Harvest,doc,"#Iharvest.jpegqq#HHarvesting
qq• Kinnow is generally harvested by secateurs/clipper followed by dropping on the ground and collection in crates/bags which ultimately accounts for considerable post-harvest loss. Damaged fruits during harvest are neither suitable for marketing nor for consumption.
qq• Postharvest losses of kinnow were highest at farm level (32.4%) followed by picking (19.6%), packaging (3.5%), carrying (2.2%), loading and transportation (7.1%) (Ahmad et al. 2015). The combined harvest and post-harvest losses in kinnow are to the tune of 25–30%. However, this quantum of losses can be effectively minimized with appropriate processing of kinnow into different value-added products. qq
qq• Citrus fruits have a relatively longer post-harvest life in comparison with other tropical and subtropical fruits. Proper storage of citrus fruits for an extended period is very essential for their proper utilization in the glut season.
qq• Kinnow is highly cherished as fresh and in processed form as well due to its quality attributes, particularly its tangy taste. While at its peak production during winter, it is processed into juices by the industry and fruit vendors. The fruit is abundantly rich in vitamin C, vitamin B, ?-carotene, calcium and phosphorous.
qq• Its startling color, distinguishing flavor and nutritional content create an impulse for beverages preparation. Despite its commercial prominence and nutritional benefits, the availability of fruit during off-season is very limited due to its poor shelf life of 8–10 days."
7,0,Post Harvest,doc,"#Ipostharvest.pngqq#HPack house operations
qqAfter harvesting, the general pack house operations involved in handling of kinnow includes
 (a) Collection
 (b) Pre-sorting
 (c) Washing 
 (d) Grading 
 (e) Waxing
 (f) Postharvest treatments 
 (g) Packaging.
qq• Packaging of the fruits is done manually in corrugated fiberboard CFB boxes with an approximate capacity of 10 kg each, however this can be changed as per the requirement.
qq#HWaxing and grading
qq• Waxing is a very important unit operation followed on a wide scale for kinnow in the production catchments. As such, kinnow has a very short shelf life of 8–10 days at the ambient condition which can be extended to about 20 days if the fruit is properly waxed or wrapped. Waxing helps in reduction of moisture loss, provides the barrier for gas exchange, restore shiny appearance and provide support for preserving agents. For the said purpose of waxing, natural waxes like beeswax, carnauba wax, candelilla wax, wood rosin, and shellac can be used. Fungicides are usually added to the wax or wax emulsion. Waxing in combination with some chemicals viz. sesame oil, captafol, potassium permanganate, and mustard oil helped in improving the shelf life and reducing the physiological loss in weight (PLW) of kinnow. Waxol is a commercial paraffin wax emulsion and its 12% concentration helped in the retention of highest quality kinnow for 35 days.
qqWaxing and grading are performed simultaneously for effective domestic and export marketing. This can be achieved either manually or with size/weight based graders. As per the grading standards suggested by Directorate of Marketing and Inspection, Government of India, kinnow can be graded into six grades based on fruit diameter viz, A: 60–64 mm, B: 65–69 mm, C: 70–72 mm, D: 72–74 mm, E: 75–79 mm and F: 80–85 mm, respectively.
qq#HProcessing and value addition
qq• Significant amount of pre-harvest losses, limited shelf life at ambient condition, poor postharvest management practices urged the farmers to explore various aspects of kinnow processing. Appropriate processing may help in minimizing the market glut and also extend its availability period. The desired characteristics for processing of kinnow include, fruit being slightly soft to firm, deep orange to red in color, smooth-skinned with no deep grooves. From the processing perspective, the fruit is mainly processed in the form of juice related products like squash, nectar, ready to serve (RTS), fermented products, juice powder, etc.
qq#HPulp
qq• Kinnow pulp constitutes of juice (51–54%) with TSS (9–10.3°B), acidity (0.55–1.0%), ascorbic acid (41–53 mg/100 ml), total sugars (7.2–7.5%), total phenolic content (852–1059 ppm), antioxidant activity (65–73% DPPH inhibition), calcium (0.75 mg/100 ml) and iron (0.338 mg/100 ml), respectively. The properties of kinnow pulp and reported the corresponding values of moisture content (87.1%), TSS (10.8°B), acidity (0.69%), ascorbic acid (18.5 mg/100 ml), total sugars (4.4%), reducing sugars (2.9%), limonin (25 ppm), ash (0.46%), L value (lightness, 50.2), a value (redness and greenness, 16.0) and b value (yellowness and blueness, 38.4), respectively.
qq#HJuice
qq• The juice content of kinnow fruit generally varies due to numerous factors such as variety, climate, cultural practices, etc. On a small scale, the juice is usually extracted by hand reaming where the fruits are halved in two parts and juice is extracted by reaming the halves on a suitable rosette. The rosette is usually conical in shape and has ribbed or grooved sides. This method of juice extraction is best, as it does not break the oil cells of the peel nor crush the seeds. On the contrary, mechanical juice extractors are also available for juice extraction where sometimes, the peel is removed manually and peeled kinnow is fed into the screw type juice extractor to extract the juice. Juice yield of around 40% by manual method and yield of around 60% can be obtained by mechanical juice extraction method.
qq#HBlended juice
qq• Blended juices prepared from the concentrates of two or more varieties are available in the market. Kinnow juice is blended with less acidic and less bitter citrus juice.
qq#HJuice powder
qq• Production of fruit juice powder assumed great dimensions in recent time due to its numerous advantages in reference to ease in handling, transportation and storage. Juice powder can be a suitable adjunct for confectionery, bakery and ice cream industries. Spray drying is the most widespread of methods for drying liquid foods.
qq#HConcentrate
qq• Concentration of liquid foods reduces the expenses involved in transportation, storage and handling operations. The process also ensures the utilization and availability of fruit juice throughout the year. The concentration of kinnow juice was done under vacuum (27–28 inch Hg) at 50–60 °C in a Bucchi type (glass apparatus) evaporator.
qq#HJam
qq• Jam is unpeeled and lye peeled kinnow segments. The jam was concentrated to 70°B, packed in airtight glass jars and stored under ambient condition (16–20 °C) for 105 days. Bitterness didn’t occur in jam prepared from lye peeled segments till 105 days, whereas there was a sign of bitterness reported in jam prepared using unpeeled segments after 30 days, which gradually increased during storage. The prepared jam had TSS (70°B), acidity (1.34%), ascorbic acid (26.33 mg/100 ml of juice), total sugars (61.05%), flavor (8.33) and color (8.13)."

9,2,Propagation of Kinnow,doc,"#Ipropagation.jpegqq• The propagation of mandarin orange is largely through seed, except the `Nagpur' and `Emperor' varieties, which are propagated by budding. Like other citrus species, the seed is polyembryonic. qq• Therefore, while propagating by seed, the sexual seedlings, which are usually stunted and poor, are rogued out and the rest that are produced from the cells of the nucellus are allowed to grow. The seedlings, thus selected, are more or less uniform in growth and production. They are, however, late in bearing and remain tall and slender. qq• Budded plants do not suffer from these defects. The kinnow mandarin is usually budded on rough lemon (jambhiri, Soh-myndong or jatli khatti) rootstock. qq• The kinnow is also budded on the kharna khatta rootstock."
10,2,Plantation,doc,"#Iplantation.jpegqq• The planting of kinnow should be done on the onset of monsoon from the middle of July up to end of September.qq• The plantation of the wind breaks such as Shisham, Mulberry seeding, Mango, Jamun, Guava and Aonla etc. on the boundaries of orchard in double row helps to minimize the effect of strong winds."
11,2,Soil,doc,"#Isoil.jpegqq• It can be grown on wide range of soil ranging from sandy loam soils to clay loam or deep clay loam or acidic soils with good drainage facility.qq• Crop not thrives well in saline and alkaline soils also it cannot withstand in waterlogged soils.qq• For optimum crop growth, pH of soil should be in range of 5.5 to 7.5."
12,2,Land Preparation,doc,"#Ilandpreparation.jpegqqThe purpose of land preparation is to provide the best soil conditions which will enhance the successful establishment of the  plants. Land preparation improves site conditions in one or more of the following ways:qq• Reducing weed competition for light and nutrients.qq• Improving soil, water, and air conditions through & water cultivation.qq• Loosening tight or compacted soils to allow.qq• Reducing frost susceptibility during mounding."
13,2,Seed Rate,doc,"#Iseedrates.pngqq• Seed rate may be defined as the amount of seed required for a unit area of land to grow any crop successfully. In other words, the amount of seed required to raise a crop successfully on a given land is called a seed rate for that crop of the land.qq• Minimum plant density of 111 plants/acre should be maintained."
14,2,Sowing,doc,"#Isowing.jpegqq• sowing is the process of planting. An area or object that has had seeds planted in it will be described as a sowed area.qqThese are the some benefits of proper spacing:qq1. Nutrient Intakeqq2. Disease Managementqq3. Weedingqq4. Ease of Harvestqq5. Increased Yieldqq• The best season for planting is from middle of June (with onset of monsoon) to end of September.qq• To minimize effect of strong wind during initial growth stage, plant Mango, Guava, Jamun, Aonla, Shisham or Mulberry on field boundaries."
15,2,Spacing,doc,"#Ispacing.jpegqq• Distance between the plant to plant is called as spacing.
       qq• Leaving the right amount of space between  plants is quite important as each plant needs a certain amount of space for their roots and leaves to maximise growth. This is based on the idea that the raised beds have a better quality of soil and so the plants will grow better in a smaller space.
       qq• Each plant has specific spacing requirements for optimal growth. Spacing is determined by the species of the plant and by soil fertility. Overcrowded plants grow poorly. Plants spaced too far apart don't produce the total yields that they could if spaced more closely.
       qq• In kinnow spacing of plants should be kept 6m*6m."
16,2,Sowing depth,doc,"#Isowing_depth.jpegqq• Measure from the base of the seed to the part of the plant where it has emerged through the soil surface.
qq• In general, seeds should be planted at a depth of two times the width, or diameter, of the seed. For example, if you have a seed that's about 1/16 inch thick, it should be planted about 1/8 inch deep. For tiny seeds, place them on the surface of the soil and barely cover them with soil or vermiculite.
qq• Sowing depth is important to obtain uniform and better germination and to ensure adequate and healthy tillering, it is necessary that the seeds should be placed at optimum depth. Seed lying at a depth below 10 cm from the soil surface germinate but fail to emerge out of soil.
qq• Hence, for kinnow sowing depth should be dug  with 60*60*60cm for planting seedlings."
17,2,Method of sowing,doc,"#Imethod_of_sowing.jpegqq• Propagation in kinnow is done by T budding method. It is usually budded on rough lemon (jambhiri, Soh-myndong or jatli khatti) rootstock. It is also budded on kharna khatta rootstock.qq• Sow citrus seeds in nursery on bed of 2 m x 1 m size and with 15 cm distance between the rows.qq• When seedlings are of 10-12 cm height, transplanting is to be done.qq• Select healthy and uniform size seedling for transplantation purpose. Remove dwarf and weak seedlings.qq• If needed, pruned roots slightly before planting.qq• In nursery, Budding is done when plants are of pencil thickness.qq• Shield budding or T shape budding is done for that, T shaped slot is made in bark of tree at distance of 15-20 cm from ground.qq• Horizontal cut of about 1.5-2 cm long is given, and vertical cut of 2.5 cm long is made from middle of horizontal cut.qq• Remove bud from bud stick and insert it into T shape slots, afterward wrapped it with plastic paper.qq• T budding is done during February-March and also in August- September."
18,2,Intercrops,doc,"#Iintercrops.jpegqq• Intercropping is the practice of growing two or more crops in proximity. The most common goal of intercropping is to produce a greater yield on a given piece of land by making use of resources that would otherwise not be utilized by a single crop.qq• Take intercrop in young and nonbearing orchards. Take pea, moong, mash, cowpea and gram as intercrop. Take intercrop up to four years."
19,2,Weeding,doc,"#Iweeding.jpegqq• The unwanted plants that grow in-between crops are called weeds. The process of removal of such unwanted plants is called weeding. It has to be done 2-3 times in a week, and usually practiced during the earlier stages of crop cultivation.qqThe advantages of weeding are:qq1. The weeds compete with the actual crop for space, nutrients and water.qq2. A weeded crop will aid in better penetration of the sun and the wind beneath the soil and also reduces the humidity.qq3. Due to better penetration of the wind and the sun, it reduces the number of diseases caused by crops and also helps in controlling pests.qq4. It loosens the soil, which helps in the penetration of water to the roots of the cultivated plant.qq• To control weed, take post emergence spray of Glyphosate@1.6 Ltr/acre or Paraquat@1.2 Ltr per acre mixed in 200 Ltr of water."

21,2,Manuring and Fertilizer,doc,"#Ifertilizer.jpegqq#HPre-plant manuringqq• Available organic manures should be applied and well incorporated into the soil before planting. This practice is widely adopted in many developing countries.qq• Typically, a planting hole about 1metre in diameter and 1 meter deep is dug; compost, animal manure and green manure are mixed with the soil that has been dug out, and the mixture is then replaced in the hole before the tree is planted.qq• Tree planting holes are not used in developed countries, because of scarcity of organic manure.qq• On acid soils, limestone is usually added to the mixture for pH adjustment or, where organic manure is scarce, soil preparation consists simply of liming.qq• On some alkaline soils in arid regions, pre-plant irrigation is often used to leach excess salts from the surface soil.qq• Analysis of soil before planning to establish the orchard.qq#HTable  : Recommended fertilizer doses for different age of the plantqq#Irecommended_fertiliser_table.pngqq#HPost plant fertilizer applicationqqTable: Schedule of fertiliser application during the yearqq#Ipost_fertiliser_table.png"
22,2,Pruning,doc,"#Ipruning.jpegqq• The pruning of citrus-trees begins in the nursery. All branches that start within a few centimeters of the union are removed, leaving about half a metre of clean straight stem with a few well-placed branches.qq• All unwanted branches are removed once a month during the first year after planting, and once in two to three months in subsequent years.qq• The bearing trees require little or no pruning.qq• After the crop is picked, the branches touching the ground should be cut close to the laterals so that no stubs are formed.qq• All diseased injured and crossing branches, water-sprouts and dead wood should be removed periodically."
23,2,Health Facts of Kinnow,doc,"#Ihealth_benefits_of_kinnow.jpgqq#HDeficiency disorders of citrus fruits.
qq• Not eating enough fresh fruits and vegetables can cause the deficiency.
qq• People feel tired, weak, and irritable.
qq• Severe deficiency, called scurvy, causes bruising, gum and dental problems, dry hair and skin, and anemia.
qq• The diagnosis is based on symptoms and sometimes blood tests.
qq• Increasing consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables or taking vitamin C supplements by mouth usually corrects the deficiency.
qq• Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is essential for the formation, growth, and repair of bone, skin, and connective tissue (which binds other tissues and organs together and includes tendons, ligaments, and blood vessels). It is also essential for the normal function of blood vessels. Vitamin C helps maintain healthy teeth and gums. It helps the body absorb iron, which is needed to make red blood cells. Vitamin C also helps burns and wounds heal. Good sources of vitamin C include citrus fruits, tomatoes, potatoes, broccoli, strawberries, and sweet peppers.
qq• Like vitamin E, vitamin C is an antioxidant: It protects cells against damage by free radicals, which are by-products of normal cell activity and which participate in chemical reactions within cells. Some of these reactions can cause damage over a person's lifetime.
qq#HCauses of vitamin C deficiency
qqIn adults, vitamin C deficiency usually results from
qq• A diet low in vitamin C
qqFor example, vitamin C deficiency may result from a diet deficient in fresh fruits and vegetables. Also, cooking can destroy some of the vitamin C in food.
qqThe following conditions can significantly increase the body’s requirements for vitamin C and the risk of vitamin C deficiency:
1. Pregnancy
2. Breastfeeding
3. Disorders that cause a high fever or inflammation
4. An overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism)
5. Diarrhea that lasts a long time
6. Surgery
7.  Burns
8. Smoking, which increases the vitamin C requirement by 30%

qq#HScurvy
qq• Severe vitamin C deficiency causes scurvy. Scurvy in infants is rare because breast milk usually supplies enough vitamin C and infant formulas are fortified with the vitamin. Scurvy is rare in the United States but may occur in alcoholics and older people who are malnourished.
qq#HSymptoms of Vitamin C deficiency
qq• Adults feel tired, weak, and irritable if their diet is low in vitamin C. They may lose weight and have vague muscle and joint aches.
qq• The symptoms of scurvy develop after a few months of deficiency. Bleeding may occur under the skin (particularly around hair follicles or as bruises), around the gums, and into the joints. The gums become swollen, purple, and spongy. The teeth eventually loosen. The hair becomes dry, brittle, and coiled , and the skin becomes dry, rough, and scaly. Fluid may accumulate in the legs. Anemia may develop. Infections may develop, and wounds do not heal.
qq• Infants may be irritable, have pain when they move, and lose their appetite. Infants do not gain weight as they normally do. In infants and children, bone growth is impaired, and bleeding and anemia may occur.
qq#HPrevention of Vitamin C deficiency
qq• Vitamin C deficiency can be prevented by consuming the recommended amounts of fresh fruits and vegetables or by taking the recommended amount of vitamin C in daily supplements. Smokers require more.
qq#HThis are the effects caused due to deficiency of citrus fruits."

qq• The mite assumes serious proportions during dry spells particularly May-June in citrus orchards.
qq• In Punjab, it is found infesting kinnow, sweet-orange, lemon, grapefruit and sour-lime. Nymphs and adults cause damage by lacerating the leaves, resulting in speckled appearance of the leaves.
qq• Heavy infestation may result in complete defoliation, especially of the young nursery plants. The affected fruits become yellow and remain undersized."
32,5,Gummosis of citrus,doc,"#Igummosisofcitrus.jpegqq#HCausal organism : Phytophthora nicotianae

qq• The disease is identified by profuse gumming on the surface of the bark on tree trunk from which gummy substance oozes out.qq• The affected bark turns dark brown and develops longitudinal cracks. The wood tissues are also affected.qq• In severe cases, bark rots and the trees dry because of girdling effect.
qq#HTransmission
qq• The disease is favoured by rains, heavy to ill drained soils, excessive and flood method of irrigation leading to prolonged contact of trunk and crown with water or moist soil, high water-table, deep planting, low budding and injuries to roots or base of the stem.qq• The primary means by which Phytophthora spp. are spread through citrus orchards is by use of infested nursery stock.qq• The pathogen may be present in soil or infected roots even though disease symptoms are not readily apparent. The fungus like organism is also carried in soil on equipment when vehicles move from infested to non-infested groves or nurseries.qq• Flooding method for irrigation water may also move the pathogen from area to area. Within groves, dispersal by irrigation water occurs especially where furrow or flood irrigation is used. Surface water following heavy rains may carry the pathogen as it drains from the grove.
qq#HManagement of Citrus Phytophthora
qq• Trunk Paint: Scrap the affected bark portions of the tree trunk, branches and limbs along with some healthy green bark with the help of sharp Knife or Khurpa. Properly collect and destroy the diseased bark by burning and do not allow it to fall on the ground. Apply the fungicidal paint of Ridomil
qq• Gold (2 gm in 100 ml Linseed oil) or Trichoderma harzianum @ 100 g/l and paint Linseed oil after five days with the help of painting brush twice in a year during February-March and July-August.
qq• Soil Drench: Drenching the root zone area of the infected tree with Ridomil Gold (25 g / tree in 10 litres of water) twice in February-March and July-August. Trunk paint can be combined with soil drench for effective disease control.
qq• Foliar Sprays: Spray application of Aliette 80 WP (2.5 gm/ litre) can be made during April and September for the effective disease control. The spray application will check the lesions on the tree parts as well as regeneration of feeder roots. Aliette spray can be combined with drenching of root zone area with Ridomil Gold.
qq• Prefer basin method of irrigation or double ring or drip irrigation over flooding method of irrigation"
33,5,Citrus canker,doc,"#Icitruscanker.jpegqq#HCausal organism : Xanthomonas citri  subsp. citri

qq• This disease is endemic to India and occurs in all the citrus growing areas. It is a bacterial disease and is spread with the help of citrus leaf miner.
qq• Canker lesions start as pinpoint spots and attain a diameter of 2 - 10 mm. Their eventual size depends mainly on the cultivar and the age of the host tissue at infection.
qq• The lesions are initially circular but later may develop irregularly often aggregated at the leaf margin or the leaf tips or in a restricted area of the leaf.
qq• Lesion become visible on the underside of leaves about 7 days after infection and on the upper surface soon after. The characteristic symptom of the disease on leaves is the yellow halo that surrounds lesion.
qq• Young lessons are raised or pustular, particularly on the lower leaf surface. The pustules later became corky and crateriform, with a raised margin and a sunken centre. Lesions on fruit and stems extend 1-3 mm in depth and are superficially similar to those on leaves."
34,5,Scab,doc,"#Iscab.pngqq#HCausal organism : Elsinoe fawcettii

qq• Citrus scab attacks the fruit, leaves and twigs, producing slightly raised, irregular scabby or wart-like outgrowths. The scabs are grey or pinkish at first and become darker with age.
qq• They are more common on fruits than leaves. The raised lumps associated with scab can be confused with symptoms caused by citrus canker or with windrub abrasions. Spores of the fungus are readily produced on the surface of scab lesions on young fruits and leaves throughout the year.
qq• Spores of the fungus are spread in the orchard by rain, overhead irrigation and during spraying operations. Dew may also cause the spores to be liberated from the lesions but due to the limited splashing action, there would only be localised dispersal."
35,5,Greening disease,doc,"#Icitrusgreening.jpgqq#HCausal organism : Candidatus - Liberibacter asiaticus
qq• The range and severity of symptoms vary with season, type and extent of infection, age and nutritional status of the trees. Greening infected citrus leaves are generally small, upright and frequently have symptoms with green veins and chlorotic interveinal areas.
qq• Diseased leaves also show various types of chlorotic mottling. Leaf mottle is one of the best diagnostic symptoms of greening.
qq• In severe cases leaves become almost chlorotic with scattered dark green islands. Symptoms are often seen on part of the canopy or even only in a branch or a twig.
qq• Infected fruits are small and mis-shapen, many fall prematurely, while those that remain on the tree do not colour properly, remaining green on the stylar (lower) end and hence the origin of the name 'greening_.
qq• Greening disease is transmitted by infected budwoods and in the orchards through citrus psylla. Psylla picks the pathogen in nymphal stage and transmits it when adult.
qq#HManagement of greening disease
qq• The management of greening disease involves removal of affected unproductive trees and their replacement by disease-free budded plants developed on improved rootstock through proper indexing programme.
qq• Regulatory (quarantine) measures should be strengthened to limit movement, sale and use of infected bud wood or nursery stock.
qq• Strict control of nurseries through registered disease-free certification scheme is essential to prevent the spread of disease.
qq• Since the disease also spreads through the vector, citrus psylfa, recommended "
36,5,Citrus dieback,doc,"#Idieback.jpegqq• The term 'dieback' means death of plant from top to downwards. Citrus dieback is not a specific disorder but is culmination of several interacting factors such as pathological infections, pest attacks, nutritional disorders, unfavorable environment, faulty cultural practices, poor choice of plant material etc.
qq• The major symptoms include the complete decline of the trees through rotting of the rootlets, girdling of the trunks and dropping and blightening of the leaves. In the early stages the disease appears in the form of light to dark brown on the terminal areas of young growing shoots. The disease starts from the apical part of the shoots and under favourable climatic conditions rapidly spreads downwards up to the base of shoots which show signs of wilting and ultimately die. qq• The infected plants usually blossom heavily and bear small sized flowers and a few fruits which slow brown rotting leading to heavy fruit drop. Rotting of roots takes place and with the increase in the severity of infection, the bark gradually turns black and slips off readily."
